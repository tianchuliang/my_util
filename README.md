# my_util
This repo contains my own small utility programs
----------------
The first tool is track_uscis_rd.py. It utilizes the website
mycasetracker.org to track/compare case processing based on RD(received date). 

I am currently adding more functionalities to this tool. 

Special thanks to mycasetracker.org.
